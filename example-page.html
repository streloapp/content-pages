      <strong>Dr. Philip Davies bought his first telescope in 2010, during the post-Christmas sales.</strong> Davies, a 43-year-old family doctor from Hampshire, England, positioned the Sky-Watcher Heritage 76 Mini Dobsonian on his desk and, the night before he left for a skiing holiday in Canada, caught his first glimpse of the planet Mars in its viewfinder.

      At a bar in Vancouver the following week, Davies struck up a conversation with a 40-something ski bum named Cam. The conversation came around, as it sometimes does on barstools, to world peace. Davies mentioned his new telescope and, from there, it was a small, boozy hop to the more expansive subject of galactic harmony.

      Cam, it turned out, had strong opinions on the issue. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty">The Outer Space Treaty</a>, which has since 1967 prevented the installation of weapons of mass destruction in the Earth’s orbit, on the Moon, or, in fact, on any other celestial body, was “toast,” Cam said. The OST, a treaty which more than a hundred countries have signed, is outdated at a time when schoolchildren are able to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/apr/06/cuddly-toy-dog-launched-into-space-by-schoolchildren-video">send cuddly toys into orbit</a>. It is time for a new space treaty, Cam argued, to better govern who is able to send what into space. Then he issued his final, dramatic pronouncement: humanity is on the brink of a Third World War, one destined to be waged in outer space.
